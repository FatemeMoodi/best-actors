            In his memoirs, Perry wrote that by age 14, he became an alcoholic.[75] He became addicted to Vicodin after a jet-ski accident in 1997, and completed a 28-day rehab program at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation that year.[76] His weight dropped to 128 pounds (58 kg) as he took as many as 55 Vicodin pills per day.[77][78] In May 2000, at the age of 30, he was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center with alcohol-induced pancreatitis.[76][79]

While Perry said in 2002 that although he had made an effort not to drink on the set of Friends, he did arrive with extreme hangovers and sometimes would shake or sweat excessively on set.[3][75] During the later seasons of the series, he was frequently drunk or high on set. His castmates made efforts to help him, even staging an intervention,[75] but were unsuccessful.[3]

In February 2001, Perry paused productions of Friends and Serving Sara for two months[3] so that he could enter in-patient rehabilitation for his addictions to Vicodin, methadone, amphetamines, and alcohol.[80] He said later that due to his substance use disorder he had no memory of three years of his work on Friends.[81]

In 2018, Perry spent five months in a hospital for a gastrointestinal perforation. During the hospital stay, Perry nearly died after his colon burst from opioid abuse. He spent two weeks in a coma and used a colostomy bag for nine months. Upon being admitted to the hospital, doctors told his family that Perry had a 2% chance of survival. He was connected to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine.[77]

Two years later, while attending rehab in Switzerland, Perry faked pain to get a prescription for 1,800 milligrams of Oxycontin per day and was having daily ketamine infusions. He was given propofol in conjunction with a surgery, which stopped his heart for five minutes. The resulting cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) resulted in eight broken ribs. He paid $175,000 for a private jet to take him to Los Angeles to get more drugs. When doctors there refused, Perry spent another $175,000 to take a private jet back to Switzerland.[82] In 2022, he estimated that he had spent $9 million on his addiction, including 14 stomach surgeries, 15 stays in rehab,
 and therapy twice a week for 30 years and had attended approximately 6,000 Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.
